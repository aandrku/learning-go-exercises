Slice is essentially a pointer an array.

UpdateSlice receives a copy of a pointer to a slice that we created in the main function
that points to an array and through that pointer changes the last value

GrowSlice also receives the same pointer, but it creates a new array and a new pointer to that array, replaces the initial pointer and we no longer have a pointer to an old array in GrowSlice function call,
but it doesnt change the initial pointer in main, so slice in main points to the initial array and bigger array is gone, or will be gone after garbage collection.
